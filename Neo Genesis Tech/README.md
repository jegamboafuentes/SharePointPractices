Neo Genesis Tech inc is a software design company that produces cutting edge technology to clients around the world. Currently we are trying to leverage sharepoint for many of our internal business processes to increase productivity and efficiency. One of the major tasks at hand is to automate the new software proposal process that we use to route new ideas through the proper channels for approval. There are 2 major approval stages that this process must go through. First, the software development lead has to approve of the proposal, then subsequently, the program director must approve as well. Once approved, the proposal should be taken and deleted from the initial repository that it was created in, and stored in a separate location such as “Approved Proposals” repository.

Another major task is a way to handle team task management. The team lead requires an application (web part) to be able to create new tasks for team members and assign them a due date. We would like to be able to track tasks with visual aids, like color coding status.
For example
Green Text → “In Progress”
Yellow Text → “Due in 24 Hours”
Red Text → “Overdue”

Ideally we would like a separate list for a “Roster” of team members. The web part that you create should also retrieve all the tasks that are related to a single team member.
